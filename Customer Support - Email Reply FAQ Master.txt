#TASH Calls
Question: Will there be TASH calls in the future? There haven't been any this year.
Answer: Yes, we will be bringing back TASH calls this year. We're not exactly sure when, but we'll reach out as soon as we get some dates on paper.
 
#Historical Q&A Call Recordings in Learn+
Question: Will the historical Q&A call recordings be accessible in Learn+ after migration from Circle?
Answer: Yes, definitely. The full archive of Q&A call replays between 2020 and 2024 is available for all TPT students.
For access to live calls and recordings in 2025, students can purchase the TPT Q&A pass (available in monthly or yearly options). This allows them to keep in touch with Heidi, have her available to answer questions throughout the year, and access all 2025 Q&A call replays.

#Audio Bookmarking in Learn+
Question: Is it possible to bookmark podcast/audio and resume listening where you left off in Learn+? I'm finding it cumbersome to manually find my place each time when listening to SPICY Masterclass in the car.
Answer: Unfortunately, you can’t resume audio where you left off, but we’re working on a solution. It’s actually one of our most requested features so we’ll keep you posted!
 
#Teen-Specific SPICY Masterclass
Question: Has Heidi done a teen-specific SPICY Masterclass? I'd love something more specific for that age group.
Answer: Heidi is planning to re-record the entire SPICY Masterclass, which will include all ages. There will be a dedicated section on teenagers since they come with their own unique set of challenges, particularly with spices. This is on the drawing board and will be one of Heidi's next projects.
